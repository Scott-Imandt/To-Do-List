#G-i-s / getImageurl

##In this project, I attempted to implement an API called g-i-s. This API allows a user to type in a keyword and perform a google image search for a file.

##In the g-i-s.js file, I created you can see all functions that I created to perform an image search task. The problem with this current implementation in this application is javaScript asynchronous behavior. When you call the function in the app.js  The resulting function results in a "pending" return. I have tried numerous methods of delay/waiting for the function, but none of my implementations have worked. I left the files and functions in the program and commented them out, so you could see what I was trying to do.
